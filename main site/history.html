                                <strong>MANAGING DIRECTOR</strong></br>Born on the 19th of May, 1990 in a little town within the buckeye state USA, Riley Rowland has always been concerned with creating and giving sensations beyond
                                the scope of expectations. He started out as a chef, making rounds while attending college, where he discovered his talent for food. After college and with a Bachelor's
                                degree in the collection, Riley set out to be an event planner, creating moments and bringing smiles to people's hearts. But this was not enough, he was still
                                bound by a particular set of norm themes; weddings, birthdays and the rest.
                                This hurdle led to the birth of Rowland's Dinner, Mr. Rowland wanted no boundaries, he wanted to create with an empty canvas.

                           <strong>GENERAL</strong>
                           Assignment. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may be transferred or assigned by you only with Rowland's Dinner prior written consent, but may be assigned by Rowland's Dinner without restriction and without notice to you.

                           <strong>Export Control.</strong>  Software and the transmission of applicable technical data, if any, in connection with the Services may be subject to export controls. You agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding software and the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.

                           <strong>Governing Law.</strong> You agree that these Terms and the Services shall be governed solely by United States and Illinois law, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Any claim or dispute between you and the Rowland's Dinner Parties that arises in whole or in part from the Services, Terms or any relationship between us, shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Cook County, Illinois. You further irrevocably agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Cook County, Illinois for the purpose of resolving all such claims or disputes.

                           <strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL ACTION.

                           <strong>Entire Agreement and Severability.</strong> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Rowland's Dinner concerning the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications of any kind between you and Rowland's Dinner with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with a valid provision that best embodies the intent of these Terms, so that these Terms shall remain in full force and effect.

                           <strong>Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Rowland's Dinner failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

                           <strong>Reservation of Rights.</strong> We specifically reserve all rights that we do not expressly grant in these Terms. Nothing on the Site or in these Terms grants any right or license to use any property of any third party.

                           <strong>Modification of Services.</strong> We reserve the right to modify, restrict access to, or discontinue the Services (or any portion of the Services), temporarily or permanently, with or without notice to you, and are not obligated to support or update the Services. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Services shall be subject to these Terms.

                           <strong>Termination.</strong> We reserve the right, with or without notice, and in our sole discretion, to terminate any license to the Services, in whole or in part, and to block or prevent future access to and use of the Services.

                           <strong>Third Party Beneficiaries.</strong> These Terms do not create any right of action on the part of any third party, except for the Rowland's Dinner Parties and suppliers or others who are party to written agreements with us explicitly giving them third party beneficiary rights.

                           <strong>Attorney Fees.</strong> If the Rowland's Dinner Parties take legal action against you as a result of your violation of these Terms, the Rowland's Dinner Parties will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief granted to the Rowland's Dinner Parties.
